# Workout Tracker

**_JavaScript Object-Oriented Workout Tracker - Map Integration and Data Storage_**

#### This JavaScript Application represents a workout tracker, really focused on JavaScript objects and classes, featuring:

- **Workout Class Hierarchy:** Utilizes classes to create workout instances with specific properties and methods for running and cycling workouts.

- **Map Integration:** Integrates with Leaflet.js to display an interactive map where users can click to add new workouts. The workouts are displayed as markers on the map.

- **Form Handling:** Manages the workout form for input and switches fields based on workout type.

- **Local Storage:** Stores workout data locally, allowing users to refresh the page without losing their workout history.

- **Event Handling:** Listens for form submissions, type changes, and clicks on the workout list to highlight the corresponding map marker.

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to user input and adjusts the displayed information based on the type of workout.

- **Application Initialization:** Initializes the application, retrieves stored data, and sets up event listeners.

- **Popup Rendering:** Displays workout details in popups when markers are clicked on the map.

- **Reset Functionality:** Provides a method to reset the stored workouts.

_This code showcases a strong emphasis on JavaScript objects and classes, making it a robust foundation for a workout tracking application with advanced object-oriented programming principles._
